# MongoDB with Mongoose

This basic app connects to the MongoDB server and uses the connection to add and retrieve users. 

The .env-sample shows you how to set up your .env file. 

You will also need to run `npm install` to get the required packages, namely mongodb, dotenv, express, and body-parser.
